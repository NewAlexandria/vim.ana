INTRODUCTION                                    *indexed-search*

This plugin redefines 6 search commands (/,?,n,N,*,#). At every 
search command, it automatically prints >
       "At match #N out of M matches".
<
-- the total number of matches (M) and the number(index) of current match (N).
This helps to get oriented when searching forward and backward.

There's only one command and no new behavior to learn.  Just watch the bottom
line when you do /,?,n,N,*,#. 

Works on vim7.  Won't cause slowdown on very large files (but then counters
are not displayed).

COMMANDS                                        *indexed-search-commands*

                                                    *:ShowSearchIndex*
:ShowSearchIndex        Shows a message indicating your position relative to
                        the search matches in the file.  The message's content
                        also depends on the value of the |g:indexed_search_shortmess|
                        and |g:indexed_search_colors| options.

=============================================================================
OPTIONS                                         *indexed-search-options*

                                                *g:indexed_search_mappings*
g:indexed_search_mappings
                If 0, does not create mappings.  |indexed-search-mappings|
                Default: 1

                                                *g:indexed_search_dont_move*
g:indexed_search_dont_move
                If 1, the mappings for * and # stay on the word under the
                cursor.  Basically, *N (or #N).
                Default: 0

                                                *g:indexed_search_unfold*
g:indexed_search_unfold
                If 1, the mappings for n and N open the least amount of folds
                needed to show the match.  This is the behavior that vim's n
                and N have, so it's enabled by default.  Basically, nzv (or Nzv).
                Default: 1

                                                *g:indexed_search_center*
g:indexed_search_center
                If 1, the mappings for n and N also center the cursor on the
                match.  Basically, nzz (or Nzz).
                Default: 0

                                                *g:indexed_search_max_lines*
g:indexed_search_max_lines
                If a file has more lines than this, the plugin doesn't display
                messages,  for performance reasons. |indexed-search-performance|
                Default: 3000

                                                *g:indexed_search_max_hits*
g:indexed_search_max_hits
                When there are more matches than this, the plugin doesn't try
                to count all of them.  Instead it says, e.g. "> 1000 matches"
                Default: 1000                       |indexed-search-performance|

                                                *g:indexed_search_colors*
g:indexed_search_colors
                If 0, the messages are not displayed in color
                Default: 1

                                                *g:indexed_search_shortmess*
g:indexed_search_shortmess
                If 1, the messages are (a bit) shorter.
                Default: 0

                                                *g:indexed_search_numbered_only*
g:indexed_search_numbered_only
                If 1, the messages only contain the search count.  No
                "First of" and "Last of".
                Default: 0

=============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                        *indexed-search-mappings*

Indexed Search remaps the standard Vim keys /, ?, *, #, n and N, so that the
appropriate message is displayed afterwards. If you don't want that, you can
disable these mappings by letting |g:indexed_search_mappings| to 0.

=============================================================================
PERFORMANCE                                     *indexed-search-performance*

Plugin bypasses the calculation of match index when it would take too much
time (too many matches, too large file).  You can use |g:indexed_search_max_lines|
and |g:indexed_search_max_hits| to tune these performance limits.
