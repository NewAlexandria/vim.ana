INTRODUCTION						*unite-tag-introduction*

*unite-tag* is a |unite.vim| plugin for selecting |tags| or selecting files
including |tags|.

Requirement:
- |unite.vim| (Recommend latest version at https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)
Note: Using tag/include source
- |neoinclude| (Recommend latest version at
  https://github.com/Shougo/neoinclude.vim)

Latest version:
https://github.com/tsukkee/unite-tag


==============================================================================
USAGE							*unite-tag-usage*

To select tags, execute |:Unite| with argument of tag
>
	:Unite tag
<
To select files including tags, execute |:Unite| with argument of tag/file
>
	:Unite tag/file
<
To select include tags generated like |tagbar| or |ctrlp|, execute
|:Unite| with argument of tag/include.
Note: |neoinclude| is needed.
>
	:Unite tag/include
<
Also, you can filter result using parameter.
>
	:Unite tag:text
<
Other filters: >

        :Unite tag:%            " Current-buffer
        :Unite tag:/pattern     " Filter with pattern

<
This plugin does not block vim because tags' information is aggregated
asynchronously.



==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZE						*unite-tag-customize*

If you want to unite-tag instead of |<C-]>|, try to write below in your vimrc.
This allows you to use unite-tag only in normal buffers. But, if the tag
files are too large, this mapping blocks vim for a while, because unite-tag
aggregates tags' information synchronously when -immediately is set.
>
	autocmd BufEnter *
	\   if empty(&buftype)
	\|      nnoremap <buffer> <C-]> :<C-u>UniteWithCursorWord -immediately tag<CR>
	\|  endif
<

FAQ							*unite-tag-faq*

Q: I want to open files without generating tags files like ctrlp.vim or
tagbar plugin.

A: You can use "tag/include" source. But it needs |neoinclude| plugin. It uses
automatically generated tag files.
