{"name":"Vim.ana","tagline":"The portable Vim IDE with all the trimmings, one-click installable on any standard box.","body":"# Vim.ana #\r\n\r\n**Vim.ana** aims to make a 2-command install of a full vim IDE with CLI conveniences.  The focus of this repo is to deliver a Vim & related environment that can be dropped into any unix-flavor box, and without disruption to existing production configs.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Features ##\r\n* Pathogen for loading\r\n* Familiar windowing setup of File Browser + Open Files + Edit Window\r\n* IDE features via Unite and Fugitive\r\n* Prompt colorization and formatting to `user@host /path (git branch) $`\r\n* Sets up some git aliases\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Components ##\r\n\r\nSee the commented sections of [`.gitmodules`](https://github.com/NewAlexandria/vim.ana/blob/master/.gitmodules)\r\n\r\n   Loader, IDE, 'Windowing', Formatting, Syntax Colors\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Install ##\r\n\r\n1. **Vim 7.2 is recommended.  Some version greater than 7.0.23 is required for buffergator, unite, and possibly others.**\r\n\r\n2. Download and unpack to `~/.vim.ana` (the installer will look for it here. You can move it later)\r\n\r\n``` cd ~; git clone git@github.com:NewAlexandria/vim.ana.git .vim.ana ```\r\n\r\n    > If your corporate enterprise firewalls `ssh` to GitHub, then you can use this link\r\n    > \r\n    > ` cd ~; git clone https://github.com/NewAlexandria/vim.ana.git .vim.ana `\r\n\r\n3. link files and [do some other business](https://github.com/NewAlexandria/vim.ana/blob/master/install.sh)\r\n\r\n` .vim.ana/install.sh `\r\n\r\nThe installer responsibily makes backups of your original .vim files to ~/.vim.ana/backups/  You can safely uninstall the files if need be (unlike if I'd `cp -R` the lot into your existing `.vim`)\r\n\r\nThe submodule bundles are automatically pulled down.\r\n\r\n4. You'll want to remember to install [the *ctags* library](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/).  Installation strategies differ per-platform, and I wanted the `install.sh` to be robust.  If you're on OS X, you can ``brew install ctags``\r\n\r\nThat's it for now.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Customization ##\r\n\r\nIf you want to add your own plugins, note that this repo uses git submodules:\r\n\r\n* Additions: `cd ~/.vim.ana; git submodule add git-repo-address .vim/bundles/name-of-repo`\r\n\r\n* Removals:  [Follow these instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1260748/how-do-i-remove-a-git-submodule)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Sauce ##\r\n![The awesomeness you'll get with this repo](http://i.imgur.com/p262L.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Mañana ##\r\n\r\nThe following Vim plugins are under review\r\n\r\n- [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)\r\n- [supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab)\r\n- [ruby.vim](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby)\r\n- a proper tag parses for ruby namespaces, since 'ctags' fails at this, perhaps [tagfinder](http://andrewradev.com/2011/10/15/vim-and-ctags-finding-tag-definitions/), or [rdoc-tags](https://github.com/rdoc/rdoc-tags)\r\n- [tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) (probably to swivel-out in the same way that <leader-w> hides everything right now.)\r\n- [AlignMaps](http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/align.html)\r\n- VCSCommand\r\n- netrw\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Спасибо #\r\n\r\nThanks for experimenting with this repo. **Architectural** suggestions highly welcome. I'm particularly interested in \r\n\r\n* How this can more-safely integrate with your existing environment practices\r\n* How to lower the version dependecy with Vim\r\n* How to integrate with windowing apps on all platforms\r\n* How to get the lauch time near-instant (takes as much as 1.5 sec on slow slices)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
